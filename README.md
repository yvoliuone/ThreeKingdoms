# ThreeKingdoms
A Java implementation of the 1v1 version of the Chinese board game "Legend of the Three Kingdoms".

Rules of the original game can be found on the wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legends_of_the_Three_Kingdoms#Basic_rules_of_the_standard_mode

This is a simplied version with less cards and two players only. There is no role cards, and the goal is to kill the other player. 

This project is unfinished.
